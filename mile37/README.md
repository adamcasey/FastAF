Need to run:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm install concurrently http-proxy-middleware`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm install nodemon`  

## Notes
`concurrently` will let us run our server and our React app all in one command  
`http-proxy-middleware` will allow us to setup a proxy so we can run our server and app on the same port
New command to run from termianl will just be `npm run dev`
